#### [A Framework for Universally Composable Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2017/papers/324.pdf)

#### Background & our work

- some first steps have been taken to get rid of reduction proofs for real-world key exchange protocols
- base on the work by KÃ¼sters and Tuengerthal, provide an ideal functionality in the universal composability setting
- a new general ideal key exchange functionality
- application to three practical DH key exchange protocols: ISO 9798-3, SIGMA, OPTLS
- many approaches strive to achieve some kind of modularity in order to tame the complexity, but security proof are typically still very bad, due to every protocol has to carry out reduction proofs again
- main idea: a real protocol P' may use an ideal functionality F as a subroutine to perform its task, typically one shows that P' realizes another (high-level) ideal functionality F'
- main contribution: 
  - extend the ideal functionality from previous work
