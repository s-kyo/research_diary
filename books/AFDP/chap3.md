#### Basic Techniques and Composition Theorems

##### Useful probabilistic tools

- **Additive Chernoff Bound & Multiplicative Chernoff Bound**: mean can be estimated with expectation with small deviation

- Azuma's Inequality: we can prove Chernoff bound from it![](chap3-1.PNG)

- Stirling's Approximation

##### Randomized response

privacy is obtained by process, there are no good or bad response

##### The Laplace mechanism

- $l_1$-sensitivity, Laplace distribution
- Laplace mechanism preserves $(\varepsilon,0)$-differential privacy
