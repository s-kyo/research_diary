#### [walk2friends: Inferring Social Links from Mobility Profiles ](https://acmccs.github.io/papers/p1943-backesA.pdf)

#### our work

- a novel social relation inference attack
- not require the adversary to have prior knowledge
- effective, 13-20% improvement
  - inference attack, feature learning model, which preserves a user's mobility neighbors -> utilize similarity to infer if users are related
  - countermeasures, hiding & replacement & generalization

#### previous work

- conducted with a data-mining perspective, reduces the scope of their applicability
- no mitigation techniques have been proposed and evaluated so far for countering potential adversarial social link inference
